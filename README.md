As a portfolio, I'm using this file to guide your through the development process. On a high-level, the steps were: 
  1. Create a local PostgreSQL database  
  2. ETL: Ingest commonly used 'Northwind' data set from Microsoft to populate the database
  3. Analyses: CTE based SQL query and transform data
  4. Version control: Commit query to Github Repo
  5. Visualisation: Create Tableau Public Dashboard based on dataset
